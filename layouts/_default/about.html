        Been an engineering student is great but the nitty-gritty is rough. To
        say, the two most abstractive electrical engineering course most
        student do have problem with is <u>Circuit Analysis</u> and
        <u>Electromagnetics</u> with a plus of demystifying engineering related concepts.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        <u>Circuit Analysis</u> is a little bit straight forward but for
        <u>Electromagnetics</u>, forget it. It's full of abstraction and it is
        the reason why we stood up to :
      </p>

      <p class="reason-one">
        Limit the use of big textbooks if what we are looking for can be
        learnt in no time.
      </p>
      <p class="reason-two">
        Limit the boring and abstractive courses by explaining stuff in a
        better way.
      </p>
      <p class="reason-three">
        Help engineering student to find a small cloud where they can get some
        of their problem sets solved.
      </p>
      <p class="reason-four">
        Go an extra mile to help engineering student on how to be productive, use time effectively and learn skills that payoff as a student. 
      </p>

          Feel free to get in touch with us on any stuff that might look
          abstractive to you, cheers. We're waiting to hear from you.
