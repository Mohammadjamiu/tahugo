When any experiment or scenario involves probability or the need for probabilistic model then a random process and random variable must be considered.

## what is a random process?

{{< ste >}} Random process {{</ ste >}} can be thought of as the collection of random variables.
It can also be defined as a time varying function that assign the outcome of a random event or experiment to each time instant. e.g. a signal.

## what is a random variable?

{{< ste >}} Random variable {{</ ste >}} is a variable whose value is the outcome of a random process. In order words when there is a random event or experiment then the outcome at any instant of time is assigned to a variable termed as random variable.

For example, tossing a coin will either yield a head or tail. The tossing of the coin is the random experiment because you don’t know whether it will turn out to be head or tail. After tossing, when an outcome is gotten either head or tail then it can be assign to a variable.

S = {H, T} where S is the sample space holding all the possible outcome.
P(X=head) – this is the probability that a head will be gotten, where X is the random variable.

## Type of random processes

{{< ste >}} Strict sense stationary random process {{</ ste >}}
A random process is said to be strict sense stationary or simply stationary if none of its statistics is affected by a shift in time origin. i.e. the occurrence of a function x(t1) at t1 is same at x(t2) when there is a shift from 1 to 2.

{{< ste >}} Wide sense random process {{</ ste >}}
A random process is said to be wide sense stationary if two of its statistics (mean and autocorrelation) is not affected by a shift in time origin or do not vary with a shift in time.
