{{< ste >}} The communication between two devices can be said to be simplex, half-duplex and full duplex{{</ ste >}}.

## Simplex mode of communication

In simplex mode, the direction at which devices communicate is unidirectional i.e. one can only send while the other can receive and not the other way round.
For example, a keyboard can only send to a monitor, and a monitor can only display the information on its screen.

## Half duplex mode of communication

In half-duplex, each device can both transmit and receive information or communicate with other devices but not at the same time. Just as in walkie-talkie where if one is sending you an information, you cannot listen or reply unless he/she releases.

## Full duplex mode of communication

In full-duplex which can be called duplex for short, devices can both transmit and receive information or communicate with one another simultaneously. Just as in the telephone network.
