## Definition of Frequency modulation (FM)

{{< ste >}} Frequency modulation (FM){{</ ste >}} is a type of angle <a href="/electronics/what-is-modulation-in-communication-its-types-and-why-we-modulate" class="links-to-article">modulation</a> in which the frequency of the carrier wave (mostly sine wave) is varied in accordance to the frequency of the modulating or message signal while keeping amplitude and phase constant.

## Derivation of frequency modulation (FM) formula

In general, angle modulated signal is represented as S(t) = Ac cos(thetai(t)) and the instantaneous frequency (i.e. the frequency at each instance) is defined as fi(t) = fc + kfm(t).

From this, here are few things to understand;

The instantaneous frequency has the combination of the frequency of the carrier wave itself, the message signal m(t) and frequency sensitivity kf. But as the angle modulated wave is a function of theta, we need to express frequency in terms of theta.

Recall that angular frequency w = the derivative of theta, so to get theta we need to integrate bothside. Also recall that w=2pif and substitute.
